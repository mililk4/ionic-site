<h1>About Ionic</h1>

<h5>
	Ionic is a 100% open source HTML5 mobile framework, with a permissive MIT license that can be used in any kind of app. This project has a <a href="http://drifty.com" target="_blank">bootstrapped profitable company</a> supporting it, so you can expect the project to receive the love and attention it deserves.
</h5>

<h2>Why we built it</h2>

<p>
  Ever since we launched our first product Codiqa to make it incredibly easy to build HTML5 mobile websites and apps, we knew HTML5 had huge potential on mobile. That was in 2011.
</p>
<p>
	As devices rapidly became more powerful, many existing frameworks weren't keeping up. They were spending too much time supporting old, slow, and failing devices. They weren't focused on native development, or they weren't permissively open source. Many were approaching mobile apps as an extension of web apps, tying themselves to the URL, when native apps used the more flexible view controller pattern. Others were trying to just duplicate the default native look without adding much else.
</p>
<p>
	We wanted a framework that was incredibly well designed, that would make it easy to build the amazing, custom apps that the best app developers were making. And we wanted a framework that would be best friends with AngularJS while not requiring it, letting developers use extensions for our favorite framework- but only if they wanted. To put it bluntly, we wanted a serious fucking HTML5 mobile framework.
</p>
<p>
	So, we built Ionic to be the framework we wanted to use.
</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p>
	Ionic's focus is on native apps, not web apps. We realized we needed to be vigilant about only supporting new devices that were powerful enough to make HTML5 feel native. So, Ionic will only support new iOS and Android releases on recent generation devices (iPhone 4/4S/5/5S, iOS 6+, Android phones released within the last two years). Support for Windows Phone or any other platform will not be officially made unless those devices gain more market share. What this means is that we are incredibly focused on making a great experience on the devices that matter most.
</p>
<p>
	With that said, the way to get the most out of Ionic is by using it for lean native deveopment for iOS and Android. You will need to become familiar with services like PhoneGap, which convert the Ionic markup into native binaries. 
</p>

<h2>Where it's headed</h2>

<p>
	Ionic is starting out with a focus on native, for only recently released phones with dominant market share. Overtime, the we plan to expand the project into other markets, if applicable, and provide basic support for mobile web as well.
	Ionic's visual style is inspired by iOS 7 but not restricted to it. Our goal is to make it even easier to customize and build a wide variety of visual styles. In addition, we will be creating services around Ionic which will make working with it even easier, like including it in our drag &amp; drop builder, Codiqa.
