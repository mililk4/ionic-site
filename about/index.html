<h1>About Ionic</h1>

<h2>Why we built it</h2>

<p>
  Ever since we launched our first product Codiqa to make it incredibly easy to build HTML5 mobile websites and apps, we knew HTML5 had huge potential on mobile.
<p>
	But as devices got more powerful, the frameworks weren't keeping up. They were spending too much time supporting old, slow, and failing devices. They weren't focused on native development, or they weren't permissively open source.
<p>
	Too many frameworks were approaching mobile apps as an extension of web apps, tying themselves to the URL, when native apps used the more flexible view controller pattern. Others were trying to just duplicate the default native look without adding much else.
