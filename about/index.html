<h2>Why we built it</h2>

<p>
  We built Ionic to take HTML5 on mobile into the future. We wanted a mobile framework that looked great, and was powerful enough to build the amazing apps the best developers were building.
</p>
<p>
We knew that HTML5's time had come, and we wanted to build the framework we wish existed. We knew a great HTML5 framework had to look amazing, be incredibly fast, and be fun to develop in.
