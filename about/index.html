<h1>About Ionic</h1>

<h5>
	Ionic is 100% open source, with a permissive MIT license that can be used in any kind of app. This project has a <a href="http://drifty.com" target="_blank">bootstrapped and profitable company</a> supporting it, so you can expect the project to get a lot of love and attention. No other outside interests will have influence on the project besides you, our beloved contributers.

<h2>Why we built it</h2>

<p>
  Ever since we</a> launched our first product Codiqa to make it incredibly easy to build HTML5 mobile websites and apps, we knew HTML5 had huge potential on mobile. That was in 2011.
</p>
<p>
	As devices rapidly became more powerful, many existing frameworks weren't keeping up. They were spending too much time supporting old, slow, and failing devices. They weren't focused on native development, or they weren't permissively open source. Many were approaching mobile apps as an extension of web apps, tying themselves to the URL, when native apps used the more flexible view controller pattern. Others were trying to just duplicate the default native look without adding much else.
</p>
<p>
	We wanted a framework that was incredibly well designed, that would make it easy to build the amazing, custom apps that the best app developers were making. And we wanted a framework that would be best friends with AngularJS while not requiring it, letting developers use extensions for our favorite framework- but only if they wanted. To put it bluntly, we wanted a serious fucking HTML5 mobile framework.
</p>
<p>
	So, we built Ionic to be the framework we wanted to use.
</p>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p>
	With Ionic, we realized we needed to be vigilant about only supporting new devices that were powerful enough to make HTML5 feel native. So Ionic will only support new iOS and Android releases on recent generation devices. It will focus on native apps, not web apps. It will probably not support Windows Phone or any other platform unless those devices gain more market share. This means we are incredibly focused on making a great experience on the devices that matter most.
</p>
<p>
	Ionic will come with an awesome icon font pack filled with both iOS 7 style icons and custom default icons designed by Ben. Ionic's visual style is inspired by iOS 7 but not restricted to it.
