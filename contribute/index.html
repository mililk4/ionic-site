<!-- Conventions

<div class="docs-section" id="conventions">
  <h2>Conventions</h2>
  <p>
    We try to follow best practices as much as possible. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For any SCSS changes, try to keep CSS properties sorted in a reasonable order, with layout and sizing properties first, then cosmetic properties below that. See our code for examples.
    Feel free to run your code through
    <a href="http://csscomb.com/">CSS Comb</a>, which will sort your CSS properties in a good order.
  </p>
  <p>
    All JavaScript must pass <a href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a>, which is helps detect errors and potential problems in your code.
  </p>
  <p>
  Additionally, almost all Javascript code <strong>must have an accompanying test case</strong>. To run our test suite, install and run <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html">Karma</a> as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
<pre>
$ sudo npm install -g karma
$ karma start ionic.conf.js
</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
  Any tests you write should go in the <code>test/js</code> folder for core JS code, or in the <code>js/ext/FRAMEWORK/test</code> folder for framework-specific code. Copy the format from other tests to write your own.
  </p>
  <h5>Indentation</h5>
  <p>
    Always use 2 spaces with no tabs.
  </p>
