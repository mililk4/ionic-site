It's no secret that I'm a self-professed [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) fanboy. It's a powerful, fast, and fun framework to develop in, and learning something challenging that pays off is incredibly rewarding.

From a technical standpoint, all AngularJS developers can agree that the framework is solid and gives a strong technical foundation for your next great app. DI, designer-developer harmony, and separation of the logic and view layer are all things we can believe in.

But that's not what drew me to finally learn Angular earlier this summer. I mean, it's not the first MV* framework on the block and every day we see a new framework that improves on the deficiencies of the last ones.

No, it wasn't the fun Hello World demos or seeing a list filter with little more than some markup. Nor the thought of making my own custom directives that gave HTML super powers. Nor was it the awesome logo (that did help, though).

Instead, what drew me to Angular was the sense that we were witnessing a new application development *platform* emerging that would trascend itself and change our industry forever. I knew I just had to get on board!

When I thought about the dramatic changes Java, .NET, PHP, jQuery, Rails, Chrome, and Node.JS had for the developer industry, I realized AngularJS had a lot in common with those technologies. 

Angular started with strong early-adopter interest ("hacker" types). Next, startups started using it and building libraries and tools on top of it. Small teams in large companies started using it for internal dashboards, small projects, and technology tests. 

But then huge companies started to invest in the framework from the *top down*. How rare is it that a huge company directs their entire development team to start learning and building with a new technology? I've talked to people from huge companies like Bank of America, TSYS, to 10,000 employee financial firms

This also means your time spent learning AngularJS will pay off handsomely over the coming years as companies invest money and time into the platform. It means entrepreneurs can build startups and service companies catering to this market, and educators can make a mark as the first to train the future generation of AngularJS developers.

That's all incredibly exciting, but the thing that is unique about AngularJS is that it also transcends the platform it's built on to become something even more rare: a generic method for building software applications.

We see this with AngularDart (love it or hate it), and I think we will eventually see a compelling reason to use it on the backend with Node.js (
