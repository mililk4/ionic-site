One of the original goals of the Ionic Framework was to encourage custom mobile UI development with HTML5, building UIs that were innovative, interactive,
and fun, but weren't necessarily part of the core mobile SDK.

We've seen native developers doing this for some time. Startups and companies like Jelly, Path, Facebook, and Google have very custom mobile UIs filled
with animations, lots of interesting gesture-based interactions, and other unique effects.

I was playing with the Jelly app last week and thought the swipeable card effect was both simple, fun, and effective enough that I tons of mobile developers would want to use it in their apps after playing with Jelly (just like Path and Facebook made the draggable side menu ubiquitous).
