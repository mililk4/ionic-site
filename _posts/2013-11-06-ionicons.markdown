Last week we officially launched [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/), our open source Icon font, and were on the front page of Hacker News for two days ([link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6637369)).

Over the next few days, we had an outpouring of support as people all over the world tried out the icon font and put it to good use. Now that things are slowing down, we wanted to share some of the numbers and show what being on the front page of Hacker News can do for a project.

## The Submission

I submitted Ionicons to Hacker News at around 3 PM central time on a Tuesday afternoon. I'm not sure that is generally considered a good time to post, but it felt right and I wasn't expecting much, so I submitted it.

The post got a few upvotes pretty quickly, probably because the headline suggested free icons and HN users love free design assets. It wasn't long before it was on the front page.

But we immediately noticed a HUGE issue: the font didn't work in any browser except for Chrome, and the font files were actually corrupted! We were using [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io/) to generate the fonts, and one of our glyphs had a bad path that messed up the entire font. We were able to fix the issue after 20 minutes or so, but that mishap cost us some early momentum and left us laughing at the epic shitty timing of it all.

Over the next few days, the post received over 375 points, drawing lots of comments and a lot of love on Twitter and beyond.

## The Traffic

Over the next two days, Ionicons saw a lot of traffic. About 23,000 visits each day:

The nice thing is the baseline traffic has gone from almost nothing to several thousand visits per day. The initial blast has created some stickiness!

## The Stars

Since last Tuesday, the [Ionicons GitHub repo](https://github.com/driftyco/ionicons) grew from 60 stars to over 2400 stars! It was the trending repo on GitHub for almost a week, and is the #1 weekly trending repo right now. It also grew to be the 11th most popular repo for the entire month. The GitHub love is almost my favorite part of the whole experience.

It did help that we had [@mdo's](http://twitter.com/mdo) great [GitHub Buttons](http://ghbtns.com/) on the front page of Ionicons to easily star the repo.

## The Follows

The [IonicFramework](http://twitter.com/ionicframework) twitter account grew from about 600 follows to 1400 which was really nice, and spawned a lot of discussion on Twitter.

## The Community

Over the last week hackers in the community built an [iOS plugin](https://github.com/TapTemplate/ionicons-iOS) for using Ionicons right in your iOS apps, and a great [search tool](http://glyphsearch.com/) for searching FontAwesome, Glyphicons, and Ionicons easily, using a variety of search terms to normalize all the strange names we all give icons.

Also, right when the post hit the front page, we had many issues filed and pull requests opened on the project, which was awesome and helped us fix a lot of random issues. 

## Open Source Fucking Rocks

Ionicons is probably the most successful open source project any of us has ever had.
