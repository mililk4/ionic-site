<h1>Submit your Ionic App</h1>

<p>
  We want Ionic to be the best way to build HTML5 mobile apps, and to do that we need to show the world what is possible when you give talented, creative people around the world (like you!) great tools to help them be successful.
</p>
<p>
So, if you've built something cool with Ionic, we want to see it and help promote it to the hundreds of thousands of people across the <a href="http://drifty.com/">Drifty</a> product network, for free.
