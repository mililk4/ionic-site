<h2>Ionic Examples</h2>

<p>
  One of the fastest ways to get up and running with Ionic is our <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-angular-cordova-seed">ionic-angular-cordova-seed</a> start project.
</p>
<p>
  But we also have a growing list of <a href="/examples/starters.html">starter templates</a> with common mobile UI layouts, and we are working on gathering real Ionic apps built by the community. If you are working on an Ionic app and want to share it and get free promotion in return, please <a href="/examples/submit.html">submit your app</a>!
