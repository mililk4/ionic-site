Swipeable cards are an emerging mobile UI, seen in new apps like [Jelly](http://jelly.co/).

Cards make it easy to display modal content that fills the center of the screen,
letting the user swipe it away to bring up a new bit of content.

We built a similar UI that you can use in your own Ionic apps. To use it, 
check out the [Ionic Swipe Cards](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-contrib-swipe-cards) repo
and follow the guide.

Or, download the starter Cordova project below:
