# Chapter 2: Getting Everything Installed

In this chapter, we are going to walk through the process of downloading Ionic and installing all necessary dependencies for development.

## Platform notes

First, we need to start with a note about minimum requirements for building your app with the current release of Ionic. For the first releases, Ionic only works on recent iPhone and Android devices. We support iOS 6+, and Android 4.2+. However, since there are a lot of different Android devices, it's possible certain ones might not work. As always, we are looking for help testing and improving our device compatibility and would love help from the community on our [GitHub](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic) project.

You can develop Ionic apps on any operating system you prefer. In fact, Ionic has been developed at various times on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows. However, right now you'll need to use the command line in order to follow this guide and you must have OS X in order to develop and deploy iPhone apps, so OS X is recommended if possible.

If you are on Windows, make sure to download and install [Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/download/win) and optionally [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/). You will be executing any commands in this guide in the Git Bash or Console2 windows.

First, we will go and install the most recent version of [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/), which will take our app and bundle it into a native wrapper to turn it into a traditional native app. There are other possible tools you could use instead of Cordova, including [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) proper (the Adobe version of Cordova that has some additional Adobe service bundled in), [Trigger.io](https://trigger.io/), or a custom solution.

To install Cordova, make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then run

    $ sudo npm install -g cordova

Drop `sudo` from the above command if running on Windows. Depending on the platforms you wish to develop for, you'll need to install platform-specific tools. Follow the Cordova platform guides for [Android](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.1.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide) and [iOS](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.1.0/guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html#iOS%20Platform%20Guide) to make sure you have everything needed for development on those platforms. Luckily, you'll only need to do this once.

  If you are running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu, you'll need to install the 32-bit libraries since Android is only 32-bit at the moment. 
  <code>$ sudo apt-get install ia32-libs</code>
</p>

<p>
  Windows users developing for Android: You'll want to make sure you have the most recent [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) (NOT just the JRE) installed and that you have installed ant. To install ant, download a zip from <a href="http://www.interior-dsgn.com/apache//ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.9.2-bin.zip">here</a>, extract it, move the first folder in the zip to a safe place, and update your PATH to the <code>bin/</code> folder in that folder. For example, if you moved the ant folder to <code>c:/</code>, you'd want to add this to your PATH: <code>C:\apache-ant-1.9.2\bin</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Next, set a path entry for JAVA_HOME pointing to the root of the JDK folder that was created when you installed the Java JDK above. So, if you installed the JDK into <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk7</code>, set JAVA_HOME to be this path. After that add the JDK's bin directory to the PATH variable as well, following the previous assumption, this should be <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk7\bin</code>
</p>
<p>
  Cordova also requires the ANDROID_HOME entry to be set, this should point to the <code>[ANROID_SDK_DIR]\sdk\tools</code> directory.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you make changes to the PATH, or any other environment variable, you'll need to restart or open a new tab in your shell program for the PATH change to take effect.
</p>

## Install Ionic

Then, we can go download the [most recent release](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/releases) of Ionic. It is not recommended to clone the repo for production apps
unless you want to live on the bleeding edge.

Once you have the most recent release of Ionic, extract it anywhere you like on your computer. We are only going to be needing some of the files for our app, specifically the ones in the `dist/` folder, and possibly the ones in the `scss/` folder for more advanced usage (more on that later). For the sake of getting started, we will start with the most basic usage of Ionic.

## Create the project

Now, we need to create a new Cordova project somewhere on the computer for the code for our app:

    $ cordova create hello com.ionic.toderp Toderp 

That will createa folder called `hello` in the directory the command was run. Next, we will change into that directory:

    $ cd hello

If you are planning on using any version control system, you can go ahead and set it up using this new folder. For new apps, follow this folder structure to get up and running quickly:


Go ahead and copy the `dist/` files from the Ionic code (in `IONIC_PATH` below) we extracted above into the various `www/*` folders inside of the hello folder:

```bash
$ cp IONIC_PATH/dist/js/* www/js/
$ cp -R IONIC_PATH/dist/css/* www/css/
$ cp -R IONIC_PATH/dist/fonts/* www/fonts/
```

The `fonts/` folder is optional, but contains our free [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/) icon pack, which has over 400 free, MIT licensed icons. You can always use a different icon pack.

## Configure Cordova

Now, we need to tell Cordova that we want to enable the iOS and Android platforms:

```bash
$ cordova platform add ios
$ cordova platform add android
```

If you see errors here, make sure to follow the platform guides above to install necessary platform tools.

We need to install at least one required plugin, the Device API, which lets us query device information:

```bash
$ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.device
```

To make our lives easier, let's also install the console plugin so we can see our `console.log` calls in XCode and the Android IDE:

```bash
$ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.console
```

Just to make sure the default Cordova project worked, try building and running the project:

```bash
$ cordova build
$ cordova emulate android
```

Be patient, this takes serveral minutes as the Android emulator is booted up. If you don't see anything happen for a few minutes, make sure you've created an Android Virtual Device (AVD), and that it is using the Android SDK version 17 or above. You might have to [reduce the amount of memory](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7222906/failed-to-allocate-memory-8) the AVD is using if you don't see the emulator boot up in a minute. The platform guide above has more information. You may also want to double check that you have the sdk and platform tools in your PATH as noted in the platform guide.

The emulator takes a LONG time to boot. After about 5 or 10 minutes, you should see the default Cordova app running in the emulator:

<img src="http://ionicframework.com.s3.amazonaws.com/guide/0.1.0/1-emulator.jpg" alt="Android Emulator">

## Clearing the defaults

Before we start building our app, we should remove all the Cordova default code. Go ahead and run the following commands:

```bash
$ rm www/index.html
$ rm www/js/index.js
$ rm www/css/index.css
$ rm www/img/logo.png
```

## AngularJS and other dependencies

The first versions of Ionic utilize AngularJS heavily. We think it's the best way to build applications in the browser today, and we've built a lot of great mobile functionality around it. In the future, we hope the community will create extensions for other frameworks like [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) and [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), to name a few.

For our example apps, we will be using the 1.2.x version of Angular, and older versions are _not_ supported. Ionic-Angular needs Angular 1.2.x along with ngAnimate, ngTouch, ngSanitize, and ngResource at least.

Now we are ready to start building our app, so continue on to the next chapter:
