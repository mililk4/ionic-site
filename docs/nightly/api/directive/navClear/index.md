  nav-clear



</h1>





nav-clear is an attribute directive which should be used with an element that changes
the view on click, for example an `<a href>` or a `<button ui-sref>`.

nav-clear will cause the given element, when clicked, to disable the next view transition.
This directive is useful, for example, for links within a sideMenu.
