title: "Ionic Framework - Device Compatibility"
---

Ionic is a new framework, and as such we only support a subset of the available devices on the market. We are constantly looking to expand our device compatibility. To help, read the <a href="/contribute">Contributor</a> guide, and join us on our <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic">GitHub repo</a>.

<h2>Compatibility Table</h2>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Platform</th>
      <th>Versions Tested</th>
      <th>Devices Tested</th>
      <th>Grade</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>iOS</td>
      <td>iOS 6, 7</td>
      <td>iPhone 4,4S,5,5S,5C</td>
      <td>A+ (best support)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
