Content
===

Ionic provides easy to use content area directives for use in AngularJS projects that can be configured to use Ionic's custom Scroll View, or use the built in overflow scrolling of the browser.

While we recommend using the custom Scroll features in Ionic in most cases, sometimes (for performance reasons) only the browser's native overflow scrolling will suffice, and so we've made it easy to toggle between the Ionic scroll implementation and overflow.
