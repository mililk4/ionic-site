  <div class="feature-row img-performance">

    <h4>Performance obsessed</h4>
    <p>
      Speed is important. So important that you only notice when it doesn't work. Ionic is
      built to perform and behave great in the latest mobile devices. With <strong>minimal DOM</strong>
      manipulation, <strong>zero jQuery</strong>, and <strong>hardware accelerated</strong> transitions,
      one thing is for sure: you'll be impressed.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="feature-row img-angular img-right">

    <h4>AngularJS &amp; Ionic</h4>
    <p>
      A match made in heaven. Ionic utilizes <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>
      in order to create a framework most suited to develop rich and robust applications. Ionic not only
      looks nice, but its core architecture is for <strong>serious app development</strong>, 
      and AngularJS ties in perfectly.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="feature-row img-native">

    <h4>Native focused</h4>
    <p>
      Ionic is modeled off of popular native mobile development SDKs, making it easy to understand for
      anyone that has built a native app for iOS or Android. Just drop it in your code to get going,
      and push through PhoneGap when it's ready. Develop once, deploy everywhere.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="feature-row img-design img-right">

    <h4>Beautifully designed</h4>
    <p>
      Clean, simple, and functional. Ionic has been designed to work and display beautifully on all
      current mobile devices. With tons of popular mobile components, typography, interactive
      paradigms, and gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme, you'll wonder how you lived without it.
    </p>

  <div class="feature-row img-nerds">

      <h4>Built by nerds (like you)</h4>
      <p>
        Built and maintained by developers and designers passionate about web technologies. Ionic focuses
        on standards compliant code, is forward thinking, and managed through 
        <a href="https://github.com/driftyco/ionic">Github</a>. We want to make
        mobile development with HTML5 awesome and simple.
