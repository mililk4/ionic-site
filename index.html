  <p class="lead">Ionic is the most advanced HTML5 mobile app development framework, optimized for building amazing
  cross-platform native apps. You've never seen HTML5 feel so native!
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We built Ionic to bring HTML5 on mobile into the future. We wanted a serious framework that could be used
    to build the amazing, custom apps that the best app developers were making. A framework that transcended the URL bar and 
    was best friends with AngularJS (while not being restricted to it).
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
  We knew Ionic had to be 100% free and open source, so we are releasing it under a permissive MIT license that can be used in any project. We will be building and extending our <a target="_blank" href="http://drifty.com/">current products</a> to support Ionic, as well as building new services around it.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We are just putting the finishing touches on Ionic, and are shooting to release sometime in mid to late October 2013.
