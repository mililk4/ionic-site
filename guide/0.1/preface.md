# Chapter 1: Getting Started with Ionic

This is the official guide to building HTML5 apps with the Ionic framework, written by the [creators](http://drifty.com/) of Ionic. It contains all you need to know to get started building apps with Ionic, and lays a foundation for more advanced development.

If you've used other mobile development frameworks in the past, you should find Ionic fairly similar to use. But getting started with any framework is always daunting, so we will start simple and expand on some basic concepts.

## What is Ionic, and where does it fit?

Ionic is an HTML5 mobile app development framework targeted at building hybrid mobile apps. Hybrid apps are essentially small websites running in a browser shell in an app that have access to the native platform layer. Hybrid apps have many benefits over pure native apps, specifically in terms of platform support, speed of development, and access to 3rd party code.

But they also have drawbacks. On older devices, Hybrid apps run slower than native apps because there is an additional layer of overhead for the browser. They also don't support all native controls, and have different access to low level APIs.

We built Ionic because we strongly believed that HTML5 would rule on mobile over time, exactly as it has on the desktop. Once desktop computers became powerful enough and browser technology had advanced enough, almost everyone was spending most of their computing time in the browser.

We also get a lot of questions about where Ionic fits into the mobile development stack. Think of Ionic as the front-end UI framework that handles all of the look and feel and UI interactions your app needs in order to be compelling. Since Ionic is an HTML5 framework, it needs a native wrapper like Cordova or PhoneGap in order to run as a native app. Ionic does not come with any backend services, though we have a few favorites that we are happy to recommend (more on that later). 

Beyond the framework itself, [Drifty](http://drifty.com/), the company behind the open source Ionic framework, provides additional services and tools to make your Ionic development experience better.
